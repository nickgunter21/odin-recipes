    <h2>Recipe:</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat oven to 180C/350F (all types).</li>
        <li>Heat oil in a very large skillet or dutch oven over medium high heat.</li>
        <li>Add bacon, cook for 30 seconds (to start fat melting), then add sausages. Cook until sausages are golden - about 3 minutes - then remove into bowl.</li>
        <li>Add chicken into the pan and cook until golden (doesn't need to cook inside), then add to bowl with bacon.</li>
        <li>Sear prawns in the pan for 1.5 minutes on each side, then transfer to a separate bowl (reserve until later).</li>
        <li>Add butter, then garlic, onion, celery and capsicum. Cook for 5 minutes or until soft.</li>
        <li>Add rice, stir to coat grains in oil.Add chicken broth, tomato paste, canned tomato, thyme and Spices. Stir well, then add chicken, sausages and bacon (including all liquid).</li>
        <li>When you see bubbles across most of the surface, stir well once more. Ensure all rice is submerged, cover with lid, then transfer to oven. </li>
        <li>Bake 30 minutes, then remove - rice should be practically cooked</li>
        <li>Add prawns/shrimp and green onions, QUICKLY (but gently!) stir through, cover with lid, and return to oven for just 3 minutes (just to heat prawns)</li>
        <li>Remove from oven (see video for finished consistency), stir gently then serve, garnished with more green onions if desired.</li>
    </ol>
